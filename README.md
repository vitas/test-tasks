## Testing Task

Write a console application what merges overlapped intervals.
Input list of intervals, output list of merged overlapped intervals and intervals what could not be merged

Example:
Input: [25,30] [2,19] [14, 23] [4,8]  Output: [2,23] [25,30]


### Goals
Try to achieve best algorithmic efficiency (complexity, memory usage, estimated time)

### Limitations and Constraints
- min two intervals could merged
- interval length should be between 1..n
- start on interval could be >1 and <= end of interval
- end of interval < n

### Selected language
golang

### Solution evoluation
TBD

### Make and build
TBD

### How to run tests
TBD
